# flask-tutorial-series
Welcome to the Jerhub Flask tutorial series. In this series, we will learn how
to create web applications with Python and Flask. The focus will be on various
backend integrations rather than frontend pretties, though basic templates will
be provided. Each section of the tutorial will build upon what we have learned
in the previous sections, so it is recommended to follow along sequentially.

**Part 1 - Scaffold** - Covers installation and configuration, and
provides the foundation from which we build the application, including a basic
app with a sqlite database, a user model, and a login page.

**Part 2 - Recaptcha** - Covers bot mitigation by adding Google Recaptcha
functionality.

**Part 3 - Contact** - Covers adding a working contact form with AWS SES.

**Part 4 - Blog** - Covers adding blogging functionality to the app, integrating
a WYSIWYG editor, and model, views, and templates to demonstrate its use.

**Part 5 -** To be determined; stay tuned!

## Requirements
In order to follow along successfully, you will need:
- Python version >= 3.10.5 - 
[Get Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- git - 
[Get git](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation)
- A real code editor (notepad won't cut it). You can use whatever you like, but
we recommend VSCode - 
[Get VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Familiarity with basic Python use - 
[Python docs](https://www.python.org/doc/)
- Familiarity with your operating system's basic command line operations - we
have no way of knowing your OS, so you'll have to search this yourself.
- Some familiarity with HTML and CSS. We will attempt to explain some of what
is provided, but the focus here is Flask backend integrations.

Additionally, some sections on integrations will require accounts with
third-party providers which may cost money:

- Part 3 Contact - SES is not free. Please review the potential costs prior
to implementing this integration:
