# flask-tutorial-series
Welcome to the Jerhub Flask tutorial series. In this series, we will learn how
to create web applications with Python and Flask. By the end of this tutorial
series, you will have a functional blogging application which you can deploy
to the internet.


Each section of the tutorial will build upon what we have learned in the
previous sections, so it is recommended to follow along sequentially.

**Part 1 - flask-scaffold** - Covers installation and configuration, and
includes the foundation from which we build the application.

## Requirements
In order to follow along successfully, you will need Python version >= 3.10.5
installed on your computer, basic familiarity with Python, and the ability to
execute commands from the command line.

## Getting Started

### Clone the repository
```
git clone  https://github.com/Jerhub-com/flask-tutorial-series.git

```

Each section contains its own README.md file, which provides instructions and
explanations.
